Install requirements:

- Install mongo (with full text search).
If using version 2.4 on a numa machine, then run like this
numactl --interleave=all mongod --dbpath data/db/ --setParameter textSearchEnabled=true
make sure data/db exists in the current directory

- Install python3. It is easy to do this in userspace
- Create a virtualenv with python3
- Install all requirements. There are some version problems, iterate a few times removing hard constraints on versions. When a system wide dependency for scipy, scikit-learn or numpy exists, try to leverage it.
